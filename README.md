While Doing a Two-Owner Search - **Important Points**

**1. Focus on the Chain of Title**
Ensure there is no break in the chain between the two owners. Missing transfers could cloud the title.

Look for unpaid debts, judgments, or mortgages recorded during both periods of ownership.


**3. Verify Document Accuracy**
Ensure the property description and ownership details are consistent across all documents.


**4. Tax Payments**
Confirm that taxes were paid during both owners' tenure to avoid unpaid tax liabilities.


**5. Easements and Rights**
Investigate whether any easements or restrictions were added during the prior owner's period that may affect the property.


**6. Older Encumbrances**
Older properties may have unresolved encumbrances from prior owners, so extend the search back as needed.
